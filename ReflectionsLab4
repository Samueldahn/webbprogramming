Reflection question 1 ----------------------------------------------------------
Q: Reflection question: What is the difference between <BootstrapSpinner /> and {BootstrapSpinner()}
when using the bootstrap spinner component in a JSX expression?


A: By using {BootstrapSpinner()} we bypass react internal functions such as using hooks and states etc. When instead using
 <BootstrapSpinner /> we let react pass props correctly and managing lifecycle.
